🔥 Hello World! I'm Manav Pathania🚀 AI Engineer | The Architect of Agentic LLM SystemsI'm a passionate and results-driven AI Engineer with 10+ months of intense, hands-on experience dedicated to launching scalable, intelligent systems. My mission is to bridge the gap between complex Deep Learning models and reliable, production-ready applications through meticulous MLOps and cutting-edge orchestration.I thrive on turning business challenges into automated, multi-agent workflows that deliver high-throughput, context-aware content and real-time decision-making.🎯 My Expertise: Where Code Meets IntelligenceAreaKey Skills & ExperienceAgentic AI & OrchestrationDesigning and implementing multi-agent workflows using LangGraph for dynamic, autonomous decision-making and content generation.Backend & DeploymentBuilding lightning-fast, robust APIs with FastAPI and handling end-to-end deployment on AWS (SageMaker, Bedrock, RDS)—from concept to cloud.LLMs & Prompt EngineeringLeveraging foundational models and drastically optimizing output quality through advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines and precise, outcome-focused prompt engineering.Data & InfrastructureEfficient data management using PostgreSQL/FAISS vector stores, developing robust data pipelines, and ensuring MLOps integrity with Docker and version control.🛠️ The Powerhouse Tech Stack I UseI don't just write code; I build production systems using the best tools available.Languages & Frameworks<p align="left"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dpython%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Python" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Djavascript%26logoColor%3Dblack" alt="JavaScript" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/R-276DC3%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dr%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="R" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-009688%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dfastapi%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="FastAPI" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-150458%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dpandas%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Pandas" /></p>AI/ML & Orchestration<p align="left"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/LangGraph-FF4500%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Ddatabricks%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="LangGraph" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Groq-00C749%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dgroq%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Groq" /><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-FF6F00?style=for-the-badge&logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white" alt="TensorFlow" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Keras-D00000%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dkeras%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Keras" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Scikit--learn-F7931E%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dscikit-learn%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Scikit-learn" /></p>Cloud & DevOps<p align="left"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-232F3E%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Damazon-aws%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="AWS" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Ddocker%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Docker" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dgit%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="Git" /><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS%2520Bedrock-FF9900%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Damazonaws%26logoColor%3Dwhite" alt="AWS Bedrock" /></p>🌟 Project SpotlightMy projects demonstrate a clear path from model development to automated, real-world utility:1. AI-Powered Media Content Generator (Agentic Masterpiece)Impact: Automated personalized marketing content delivery and generation.Architecture: Built as a multi-agent LLM system using RAG and LangGraph, deployed and managed entirely on AWS.2. Modular FastAPI Wrapper for Stanford STORM (Scalable APIs)Goal: Create a high-performance gateway for real-time NLP inference.Key Features: Implemented Pydantic validation and enabled streamed responses, all containerized with Docker for guaranteed reliability.🎓 Let's Connect!I am always seeking challenging roles in AI engineering and MLOps that push the boundaries of what agentic systems can achieve.ContactLinkLinkedInConnect with meEmailmanavpathania780@gmail.com<p align="center">AWS Certified AI Practitioner | Dedicated to Production-Ready AI</p>
